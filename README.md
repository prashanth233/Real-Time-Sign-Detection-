# Real-Time-Sign-Detection

In this sign language recognition project, I have created a sign detector, which detects numbers from 1 to 10 that can very easily be extended to cover a vast multitude of other signs and hand gestures including the alphabets.
I have developed this project using OpenCV and Keras modules of python
